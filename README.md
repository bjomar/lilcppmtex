# lilcppmtex
little example of multithreading a rather large matrix product in C++, roughly 97,3% efficient @ 4 threads on a threadripper 1950x

## afterword
This whole thing is somewhat sketchy but serves the purpose of showing off what multithreading can do,
performance sure can still be improved but i think roughly 97% efficiency is enough as a showcase. 
Dont show this to ur professor as he might cringe
